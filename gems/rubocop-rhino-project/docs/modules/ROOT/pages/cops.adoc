= Cops

In RuboCop lingo the various checks performed on the code are called cops.
Each cop is responsible for detecting one particular offense.
RuboCop RhinoProject has only one RhinoProject department.

Some of the RhinoProject cops have configuration options, allowing them to
enforce different coding conventions.
